How to Run the Project (Front-End and Back-End Together)

Create a Project Folder: Make a new folder on your computer. Let's call it AIP-Phishing-Detector.
Save the Files: Inside this folder, save the following three files:
The HTML code above as detector.html.
The back-end code from my previous response as app.py.
The requirements file from my previous response as requirements.txt.

Set Up Python Environment:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate into the AIP-Phishing-Detector folder.
Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv

Activate it:
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install Libraries:
In the activated terminal, run: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Back-End Server:
In the same terminal, run the command: python app.py
Leave this terminal running! It's now your active server.

Run the Front-End:
Open the detector.html file directly in your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox). The easiest way is to right-click it in your file explorer and choose "Open with".

Your website should now be fully functional.

Part 3: Example URLs to Check for Your Demo
Here are some URLs you can use to test the different outcomes. For your safety, just copy and paste the text, do not actually visit the suspicious or malicious links.
To Get a "Safe" Result:

google.com
github.com
wikipedia.org
(These are well-established, secure sites that should get a high safety score).

To Get a "Suspicious" Result:

update-your-account-info.xyz
secure-login-portal.net
(These use suspicious keywords and less common TLDs. They will trigger some rules but maybe not all, resulting in a "Suspicious" flag).

To Get a "Malicious" Result:

http://login.user@10.0.0.1//secure-updates/your-account-details-are-needed-for-verification/index.html
